What is Observer?
- Observer allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.
- It lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any
  events that happen to the object they're observing.
- The object that has some interesting state is often called subject/publisher/observable.
- All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher's state are
  called subscribers/observer.
- We need to be informed when certain things happen:
  - Object's field changes
  - Object does something
  - Some external event occurs

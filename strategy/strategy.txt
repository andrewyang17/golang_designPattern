What is Strategy?
- Strategy turns a set of behaviors into objects and make them interchangeable
  inside original context object.
- It separates an algorithm into its 'skeleton' and concrete implementation steps,
  which can be varied at run-time.
- The original object (context) holds a reference to a strategy object and delegates it
  executing the behavior.
- It suggests creating a family of the algorithm with each algorithm having its own class.
- Define an algorithm at a high level.
  Define the interface you expect each strategy to follow.
  Support the injection of the strategy into the high-level algorithm.

What is Template Method?
- A high-level blueprint for an algorithm to be completed by inheritors.
- Template Method allows you to define a skeleton of an algorithm in a base class
  and let subclasses override the steps without changing the overall algorithm's structure.
- It's used when the steps of a particular operation are the same,
  but these stepsâ€™ implementation may differ.
- Go doesn't has Inheritance, so it somehow almost similar to Strategy pattern.
- It not necessary has to be a struct, it can be just a freestanding function which takes
  the implementation (interface) as a parameter.

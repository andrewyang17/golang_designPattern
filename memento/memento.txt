What is Memento?
- Memento lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing
  the details of its implementation.
- It allows making snapshot of an object's state and restoring it in future.
- It is used to roll back states arbitrarily.
- Memento should not be mutable, and in actual fact, it can be problematic if it does,
 because if it exposes some state, then somebody could modify it and then return the system to
 the state in which it never was.
- It can be used to implement undo/redo if your system is simple, it is
  better handled by the command design pattern.
